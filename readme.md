Syntactic change is a type of natural language variation 
that refers to changes in the grammar of a language. 

To change the syntax, making scheme an Armenian programming language,
but only theoretically, because only the syntax has changed, the scheme
programming language works at a low level. A number of rules are defined
that allow the use of Armenian syntax.

You may have seen those rules in the rules.scm file.
to try the program, you can enter the test_gaus or test_jacobi folder,
in the .scm files, there is a code written in Armenian letters, which we want to run.

___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

2. enter either the test_jacobÕ« or test_gaus folders

1. execute the "make" command on the command line, 
which will build the necessary files for the program and make a test.

2. then use the "make clean" command on the command line to delete the created files.
